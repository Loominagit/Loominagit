### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Loominagit. People know me as Loominatrx on [Roblox](https://roblox.com/users/profile?username=Loominatrx). I usually publish my projects here (Lua and JavaScript).

As for now, I am currently working on my new [t-util](https://github.com/Loominagit/t-util) module for both Lua and Luau!

Fun fact: I learn JavaScript basics for about a day or so!
