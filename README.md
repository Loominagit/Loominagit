### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Loominagit. People know me as Loominatrx on [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/1565283543/profile). I usually publish my projects here (and sometimes contribute to other repository, like Spotiflyer for example). As for now, I am currently working on my new [t-util](https://github.com/Loominagit/t-util) module for both Lua and Luau!

Fun fact: I learn JavaScript basics for about a day or so!

### If you'd like to contact me, contact me at:

- Discord: Udin#4843
- DevForum: [Loominatrx](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/Loominatrx)
(I mostly don't read messages since I am busy IRL.)
